<p>So we hardcoded a website, with the help of a designer, and then transferred the contents of the file to a <em>blank theme</em> that we forked from a separate git repository.</p>

<p>The blank theme was loaded onto the WordPress dashboard after we downloaded the wordpress framework from the official website. Using MAMP, we have been able to view the changes after we have made them in atom. </p>
